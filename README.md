# DNNR: Differential Nearest Neighbors Regression

[![Build Status](https://github.com/younader/dnnr/actions/workflows/dev.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/younader/dnnr/actions/workflows/dev.yml)

Implementation of ["DNNR: Differential Nearest Neighbors Regression"](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/nader22a.html).

**DNNR pushes KNN regression to a gradient boosting performance!**

Whereas KNN regression only uses the averaged value, DNNR also uses the gradient or even higher-order derivatives:

Our implementation uses `numpy`, `sklearn`,Â and the [`annoy`](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)Â approximate nearest neighbor index. Using `annoy`Â is optional, as you can also use `sklearn`'s KDTreeÂ as index. We support Python 3.7 to 3.10.


# ðŸš€ Quickstart


To install this project, run:

```bash
pip install dnnr
```


# ðŸŽ‰ Example

```python
import numpy as np
from dnnr import DNNR

X = np.array([[0], [1], [2], [3]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])

model = DNNR(n_neighbors=1, n_derivative_neighbors=3)
model.fit(X, y)
model.predict([[1.5]])    
# Will output: 0.25
```

# ðŸ“Š Hyperparameters

DNNR has three main hyperparameters:

* `n_neighbors`: number of nearest neighbors to use. The default value of
      `3` is usually a good choice.
* `n_derivative_neighbors`: number of neighbors used in approximating the
      derivatives. As a default value, we choose `3 * dim`, where `dim` is
      the input dimension.
* `order`: Taylor approximation order, one of `1`, `2`, `2diag`, `3diag`.
      The preferable option here is `1`. Sometimes `2diag` can deliver
      small improvements. `2` and `3diag` are implemented but usually do
      not yield significant improvements.

We recommend a hyperparameter search over the `n_derivative_neighbors` variable to archive the best performance.

For all options, see the documentation of the [DNNR class](https://younader.github.io/dnnr/site/api/#dnnr.dnnr.DNNR).
